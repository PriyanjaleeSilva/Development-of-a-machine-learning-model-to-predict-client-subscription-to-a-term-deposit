# Development-of-a-machine-learning-model-to-predict-client-subscription-to-a-term-deposit
A support vector machine binary classification model with RBF kernel was developed to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not using a bank marketing dataset.
Bank marketing dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository and the link is provided here. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing#
